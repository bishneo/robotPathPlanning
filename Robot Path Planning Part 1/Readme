ROBOT PATH PLANNING (PART-1)
----------------------------

This is Part-1 of the Robot Path planning project for RSS5335. This part covers the three algorithms : Dijkstra, A* and Dynamic Window. Please use the below commands to execute these algorithms.

1.  For executing Dijkstra : Run "Dijkstra.py"
    For executing A* : Run "Astar.py"
    For executing Dynamic Window : Run "DWA.py"

2.  For changing the world, please edit the value of "worldImg" inside AllConstants.py.
    worldImg = 1 (For Maze-like environment)
    worldImg = 2 (For U-shaped environment)
    worldImg = 3 (For Narrow passage environment)
    worldImg = 4 (For blocked environment)

3.  For running the Stage/Player simulation tool:
	a. Install Player
	b. Install Stage
	c. Unzip this zip file and through terminal navigate to the folder
	d. Run one of the algorithm on one of the maps this will generate the path as well as the floor plan
	e. Change the starting point within the "simple.world" file line 54 to the starting point mentioned in "AllConstants.py" file. 
	e. From terminal run player simple.cfg (the world will show up)
	f. From terminal run python simple.py for the robot to navigate through path toward goal

***** Please contact us should you have any question or concerns regarding the execution of codes or simulation environemnt.
